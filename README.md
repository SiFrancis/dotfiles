my personal dotfiles setup; designed for use with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)  and WSL

# TODOs
- [-] forgot wat this is
- [-] add install commands for needed software
- [-] more programs or smth

# How to Use
- install stow with `sudo apt install stow` (or whichever package manager of your choice, it probably has stow)
- `git clone this repository`
- run the following:
```
stow . --adopt -R
```

# Requirements
programs that are *required* for the setup
- neovim
- yazi
- fzf
- zsh

# Essentials
not explicitly included in the config, but nice to have for the workflow
